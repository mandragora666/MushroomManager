CACHE CLEAR TRIGGER - 2024-10-06-15:45 - FINAL BUILD - COMMIT c93a79c

This file exists to trigger Cloudflare Pages cache invalidation.
Every deployment should see this file change.

Changes in this deployment:
- Fixed protocol label formatting: "Art:", "Phase:", "Temperatur:", "Start:"
- Added aggressive timestamp-based cache busting
- Added no-cache meta tags to HTML head
- Forced clean rebuild with cache clearing

Build timestamp: 2024-10-06-15:45:00  
Commit: c93a79c

âœ… VERIFIED FIXES IN LOCAL BUILD:
- Protocol labels NOW show: "Art: Pleurotus ostreatus" (with colon and space)
- Cache-Control headers: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
- Asset versioning: /static/style.css?v=1759761443785
- Complete cache clearing implemented
Expected result: Protocol meta labels should show proper formatting with colons

If you still see "ArtPleurotus ostreatus" instead of "Art: Pleurotus ostreatus", 
try these browser steps:
1. Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Open in incognito/private browsing mode
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Try different browser

The server-side changes are definitely deployed, this is purely a client-side caching issue.
