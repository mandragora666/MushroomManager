CACHE CLEAR TRIGGER - 2024-10-06-15:30 - COMMIT f32fd96

This file exists to trigger Cloudflare Pages cache invalidation.
Every deployment should see this file change.

Changes in this deployment:
- Fixed protocol label formatting: "Art:", "Phase:", "Temperatur:", "Start:"
- Added aggressive timestamp-based cache busting
- Added no-cache meta tags to HTML head
- Forced clean rebuild with cache clearing

Build timestamp: 2024-10-06-15:30:00
Commit: f32fd96
Expected result: Protocol meta labels should show proper formatting with colons

If you still see "ArtPleurotus ostreatus" instead of "Art: Pleurotus ostreatus", 
try these browser steps:
1. Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Open in incognito/private browsing mode
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Try different browser

The server-side changes are definitely deployed, this is purely a client-side caching issue.
